server setup:
```bash
# or move openssl call seperately, then fill the rcon_password yourself. or use a password of your own instead of random generated one.
# this will be password for your remote controller.
openssl rand -hex 32 >> playbooks/files/rcon_password.cfg 
vagrant up --provider vmware_fusion
vagrant ssh-config >> $HOME/.ssh/config
